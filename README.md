# Analysis of Chicago Crime and Predictive Modeling

Welcome to my personal attempt at exploring an unseen dataset and conducting various analyses, culminating in a predictive modeling task. Throughout this project, I have learned a great deal, and I have saved my work both as a showcase and as a reference for my future self. To make the analysis more accessible and user-friendly, I have also provided a PDF document summarizing my findings.

During the course of this analysis, I have identified several areas where improvements can be made. I have listed these areas below and plan to address them in the future:

- [x] Building a program to update the dataset on the fly using the Socrata API
- [ ] Incorporating additional external data sources such as temperature and holidays
- [x] Handling the large size of the dataset (~1.6GB)
- [x] Exploring the possibility of displaying all geographical points on a map
- [x] Working with Choropleths and GeoJSON for geospatial analysis
- [ ] Continuing to tackle the challenges of feature engineering
- [ ] Performing time series analysis and forecasting
- [ ] Considering non-linear models instead of relying solely on linear models
- [x] Utilizing GPU acceleration for boosting algorithms
- [x] Employing hyperparameter tuning with Optuna
- [ ] Running boosting algorithms in PySpark for scalability
- [ ] Determining the appropriate evaluation metric, considering Type I and Type II errors
- [x] Creating a dynamic table to display results directly within the notebook

Feel free to explore the notebook yourself using the following options:
