# Analysis of Chicago Crime
### And coming up with a prediction :feet:

This is my personal attempt into delving into an unseen dataset and come up with some analyses as well as a predictive modeling at the end. Through this work I've learned a lot which made me into saving it both as a showcase as well as a self-reference for my future self. I also provide a document as a pdf file, to make my analysis more humane and less mechanical.

There are lots of places in which some improvements can be made! I even list those so as I make the time in the future, might as well check them afterwards. These are:

- [x]Building a program to update the dataset using Socrata API on the fly
- []Providing other external data sources such as temperature, holidays, etc.
- [x]Handling the size of the dataset ~1.6GB
- [x]Is it possible to show all the geographical points on the map?
- [x]Working with Choropleths and GeoJSON
- []Looks like Feature Engineering never ceased to be a challenge
- []Time Series Analysis and Forecasting
- []Ignoring linear models all together?
- [x]Running boosting algorithms to GPU
- [x]Hyperparameter Tuning with optuna
- []Running boosting algorithms in PySpark
- []Which metric to choose? Type I vs. Type II errors?
- [x]Making a dynamic table showing results right into the notebook
